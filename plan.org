* PLAN

Not really a plan of sorts, but I'll be keeping tidbits of my notes
that don't fit in a blog here.

** cmake: ExternalProject_Add

   I discovered this recently, and I'll be trying out the dependency
   management for it with my new project.

   Maybe writing a short blog about this could be good for future notes.

** bazel: cheat sheet

   To check output on stdout. Probably can be defaults in bazelrc or
   the likes.

   bazel test --test_output=errors ...

   To build everything in a package:

   bazel test ...
   bazel build ...
