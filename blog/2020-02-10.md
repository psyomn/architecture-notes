# Dealing with your own repos

For some longer time, I've been thinking about repositories people
work on and just forget (and I'm guilty on that front too). I'd like
to see what kind of effort making builds continue passing would
entail.

I'll be going over some of my repositories and integrate them with
github actions, but on top of that, I'll try and schedule nightly cron
jobs that will let me know if the build fails.

The build should fail eventually if something drastic in the ecosystem
happens. For example a package manager version is depracated or any of
the dependencies. If the language has a drastic change that is no
longer supported, then that could probably be signaled as well.

Let's see how that goes!
