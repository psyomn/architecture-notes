# JPEG Rabbit Hole

I've been working on a project of mine which will try to tag certain
pictures of yours with a comment, in the exif section. I got curious
along the way to see what the JPEG format looked like.

I ended up finding this specification:

https://www.itu.int/rec/T-REC-T.871-201105-I/en

I was expecting something much more complicated but it seems it might
be possible to write a simple parser with not much effort. Then again
I might have not read the specification well enough.

On the other hand, I've found that there are a lot of paywalls of ISO
for JFIF, and am really wondering whether I should really bother.

# Rethinking logs

It would be nice to try out logs in the logfmt way:

https://www.brandur.org/logfmt

The obvious meh part of this is that sometimes just a line is
enough. On the other hand having parsable logs can solve the latter,
and provide more power.

# More system stuff I want to look into

recvmmsg (`man recvmmsg`) might be nice to look into one of these
days.
