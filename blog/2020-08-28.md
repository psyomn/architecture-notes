# JPEG Rabbit Hole

I've been working on a project of mine which will try to tag certain
pictures of yours with a comment, in the exif section. I got curious
along the way to see what the JPEG format looked like.

I ended up finding this specification:

https://www.itu.int/rec/T-REC-T.871-201105-I/en

I was expecting something much more complicated but it seems it might
be possible to write a simple parser with not much effort. Then again
I might have not read the specification well enough.
