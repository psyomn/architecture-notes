# Older Ideas Working Out

Context: older repository that I rejuvenated with nightly
runs/tests/builds, written in Ruby.

Seems like some of my older ideas were not too bad. The nightly builds
of some of my projects uncovered a new linting error that was
introduced into the linter.  Basically ruby gems now require a set
ruby version in the gem, to specify what it is compatible with.

I think I had the linter being pulled in from a source like master and
any new lints that the current project is not being tested with, will
be pulled in.  Wonder if this sort of thing would be viable for any
project with an actual linter.

# github.com/psyomn/psy gh

Finally got to write a small tool to standardize issue tags through a
yaml file. This means if you have a style you want to enforce wrt to
tags on github, across codebases, it's a little easier.  Wrote it as a
one off, with very simple and basic usage. The yaml would look
something like this:

```yaml
$ psy gh -generate-config
---
# Github label configuration.

# T = Type
# L = Lifecycle

rename:
  bug:         ["T-bug",       "a00000", "A software fault or failure"]
  duplicate:   ["L-duplicate", "16336d", "dOops!"]
  enhancement: ["T-upkeep",    "009a00", "Anything that rejuvenates"]
  invalid:     ["L-invalid",   "ffbb0e", "Anything that is invalid"]
  question:    ["T-question",  "ffaa99", "Questions are good!"]
  wontfix:     ["L-wontfix",   "231f20", "Things not to fix"]

create:
  - ["T-perf",    "f51919", "Anything concerning perf"]
  - ["T-feature", "078a00", "Anything that is adds new behavior"]
  - ["T-doc",     "001c8a", "Anything that adds documentation"]
  - ["T-hotfix",  "ff5100", "Critical things to deploy"]
  - ["L-ready",   "ffe100", "Anything ready for merging and releasing"]
```

And usage of said tool is super simple too:

```nocode
$ psy gh
Usage of gh:
  -dryrun
    	set to dryrun poison
  -generate-config
    	print generic config into stdout
  -help
    	print help info
  -list-labels
    	<owner> <repo> - list the labels on a github repository
  -poison
    	<config.yml> <owner> <repo> - run actual changes to labels
2020/08/10 18:42:13 error: wrong usage
```

And you should be able to query some repositories pretty quickly:

```nocode
$ psy gh -list-labels psyomnpsy
owner  : psyomn
repo   : psy
dryrun : false
labels :
  - [#16336d L-duplicate]: dOops! (default: false)
  - [#ffbb0e L-invalid]: Anything that is invalid (default: false)
  - [#ffe100 L-ready]: Anything ready for merging and releasing (default: false)
  - [#231f20 L-wontfix]: Things not to fix (default: false)
  - [#a00000 T-bug]: A software fault or failure (default: false)
  - [#001c8a T-doc]: Anything that adds documentation (default: false)
  - [#078a00 T-feature]: Anything that is adds new behavior (default: false)
  - [#ff5100 T-hotfix]: Critical things to deploy (default: false)
  - [#f51919 T-perf]: Anything concerning perf (default: false)
  - [#ffaa99 T-question]: Questions are good! (default: false)
  - [#009a00 T-upkeep]: Anything that rejuvenates (default: false)
  - [#7057ff good first issue]: Good for newcomers (default: true)
  - [#008672 help wanted]: Extra attention is needed (default: true)
```

The yaml config should probably be checked in version control as
well. I think that project configuration should probably be stored
within the project itself, instead of the metadata approach. Maybe
this is too much of a Unix flavor.

# more stuff for ecophagy!

Ecophagy is a project I'm doing where I'm identifying the fluff stuff
I like to use (like sites for movies and books), and implementing my
own tools that I can use to look up information on these things
offline. For the curious: [ecophagy](http://github.com/psyomn/ecophagy).

## github.com/psyomn/ecophagy/mvpic

Mostly things to do in the future.

Organizing books might be nice, if this dataset has the info I'm
looking for:

> https://openlibrary.org/developers/dumps

Syncing with this might be good too (to update on new movies), though
not sure how much the data will be in line with the current db
structure.
