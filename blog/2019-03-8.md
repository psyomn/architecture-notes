# Taking a different approach to experiments

I have a strange way of doing things sometimes. For example I have a
large list of projects that I always mean to get around at. And at the
same time (and I know that makes no sense), I don't really like
creating too many repositories on my github profile. And just having
shy of 100 projects on said profile, it take a lot from me not to go
back and start deleting things. Why I don't is another story for
another time.

So I've finally decided to take a rather... unorthodox approach and
create a monorepo, with most minor projects I've been interested in
supplied in tools. I am using `go` in this case, and the final product
can be shared as a simple, single binary. I implement the subprojects
as subcommands.

If I see that a particular project is useful, I then plan to move that
particular code to an actual repository, and sever it from big ball of
mud swiss army knife I call `psy`.

This is the overal jist of the idea, and I'll probably report in the
future to say how it finally went, whether it was a bad idea, or not.

Regardless, I'll just use this opportunity to say that `go` is a
pretty fun and pragmatic language :).
