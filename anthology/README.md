# Anthology

An attempt to bring everything I've written in a latex collection. This should
take LaTeX from the other writeups, as well as the markdown stuff, and compile
one document (hopefully).

Because doing this with the structure of the other writeups I have in this repo,
is going to be very hard, I've decided to go through each and add commands to
generate to stripped down tex, and hopefully automate most of this.

EDIT: this is a WIP; this ended up being a little more complicated than what I
anticipated...
