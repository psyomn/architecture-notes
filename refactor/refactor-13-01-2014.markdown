# Replace Type code with subclasses

* Common Vocabulary: Type as a Discriminator. Inheritance/Subclassing.

* Use of a discriminator variable in order to choose _specific_ behavior. The
  discriminator variable is usually an _enumeration_. The enumeration is used
  along with _switch_ or _if/elseif/else/_.

* Usually seen with giggantic switch cases or a shallow leveled if statement
  (but also long)

# Summary

* **Antipattern**:
We have a class. Depending on the value of a variable / state, there exists
some function call that exhibits different behavior depending on that 
variable's value. More behavior of different cases is aggregated to this class
over time. The discriminator values of the class also add up, and are hard to 
track, and are more error prone. _Long Method_ smell should be common as well.

* **Making things (al)right**: We understand that so much behavior crammed 
inside a class should raise flags on the design. We also should notice that a
method may start becoming too big at some point, which is another flag for 
poor design. To fix this, we _break things down_. The discriminator becomes
subclass declarations, which along them is the factored code inserted, which
is removed from these logical branches.

# Motivation

* You should do this when
  
    * The code in question has behavior dependant to discriminator

    * The logical branches are growing wide making the method in question very
      long as well.

* Don't do this when 

    * The switch / logical operation has a valid check, not involving a 'type'.

# Mechanics

1. Identify the switch/case && if/else/elseif large statements

1. Investigate which part of each block in each logical branch can be factored
   out into a subclass. Usually for each branch, you create a subclass.

1. Create subclasses for each special case

1. Remove the code from the main class with the logical branches, and put it
   in the corresponding subclass.
 
1. Find and fix the rippling changes in the application, replacing the dynamic
   type of the class, to the corresponding subclass of that particular
   discriminator.
