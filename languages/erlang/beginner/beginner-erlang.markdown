# Introduction

This is a simple guide for the Erlang programming language. It assumes that the
reader has prior functional programming experience, and that it is not required
to go over such fundamentals. We will purely focus on the programming language,
and especially how we can spawn processes in order to perform different tasks.
Finally we will look over the possibility of supervising different Erlang nodes,
and the strategy we may employ to save applications from total failure using
said supervisors.
