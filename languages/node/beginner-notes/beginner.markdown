# Setup


To work with node, you'll need to install first node on your computer. On linux
systems we can do this with the package manager.

The next step is optional but nice. There is a package manager for node. The
package manager however does not have user-only installs, so if you don't like
that kind of organization (in other words, you do not want system wide installs
of node packages), you can follow the following link to fix that:

There is an interfactive tutorial thing called learnyounode. It is possible
to install using npm.

~~~~nocode
    $ npm install -g learnyounode
~~~~

If you followed the above link, and configured your environment, you'll
be able to run `learnyounode` on the command line and view the
tutorials.

~~~~~nocode
    $ learnyounode
