title: Modular RPG Entity Stats
abstract: |
  This is a small proof of concept, of a possible, modular engine that may be
  used when creating some traditional RPG game with a leveling up system. The
  approach is to use assignable functions to the leveling up system, such that
  we can reuse the core logic of the leveling up, but have many pluggable
  modifiers for the statistics of the entities.

  This appraoch differs from Object Oriented Programming, in the sense that we
  do not need to subtype, and have a static representation of all the Entity
  Classes (eg: Rogue, Mage, Grunt), and also provides the possibility of having
  similar types, with subtle differences - for example having two similar Grunts,
  but altering the function, which determines the next level's required experience
  gain.
