title: A brief comparison of Ruby Arrays and OCL
author: Simon Symeonidis
abstract: |
  This is a small write up that will make some comparison of collection
  manipultions in Ruby, using Arrays. The Arrays in ruby have the operations
  `select` and `collect` which may help the reader get a better grasp of what is
  happening in OCL. The advantage of this comparison, is that the reader can
  easily get the Ruby interpreter, and manipulate lists for personal practice.

  However, not all OCL operations exists in Ruby's arrays. To accomodate for
  that, we will use a technique called `Monkey Patching` in order to extend the
  core library, and implement OCL operations such as `sum()`, `exists()`,
  `forAll()`, and more. The reader is encouraged to download the Ruby
  interpreter and test some of these programs on their own.
