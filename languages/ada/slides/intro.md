# Introduction

# History

- Where did Ada come from?
- Where is it going?

# It came from the DoD

- Dark Overwhelming Drakes
- Department of Defense
    - Balls to the wall requirements
    - aircrafts need advantages
    - fighter pilots fight enemies, not your software

# What did the DoD require from PLT?

- A language that is safe

# One Language to rule them all

# Things didn't go as expected

- langpop

# Why does Ada look that way

- empirical studies on:
    - usability
    - readability
    - and all that good stuff

# What is happening to Ada

- language still actively being developed on
- some example releases:
    - Ada83
    - Ada95
    - Ada2005
    - Ada2012
- this has lead the language to become massive
- like really big
- really really big

# Readability

- Things are readable, right?

```ada
    package body Hello_World is
    begin
        null;
    end package Hello_World;
```

# Where to go when in doubt

- Ada has the BNF trees/specs freely available and are pleasantly
  readable.

# Alright, let's begin with stuff

- You need an Ada compiler. At the time of writing, there's two compilers available.
    - gcc-ada (gnu)
    - adacore ada (commercial, and free if open source)
