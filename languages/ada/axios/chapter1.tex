\section{Topics of interest}
Here we discuss in a little more detail the previously outlined topics. These
topics offer us a concise and detailed tests to investigate the the Ada 2012
progrqamming language, along with other tools that can be used to supplement
and extend future projects. We will be looking at the following aspects:
\begin{itemize}
\item{The Ada2012} programming language (Language structure, strengths,
weaknesses, etc)
\item{The Ada2012 Toolchain} The \textbf{gnat} compiler, the project manager
files (gpr)
\item{AUnit} for a unit testing platform
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Concurrency}
Ada is considered to have a good concurrency support. 

% TODO Revise this part 
\subsection{Sockets}
Sockets are a good topic in this case study, since sockets are OS dependent
therefore will provide some insight on how the language and application will
behave on different platforms. 

\subsection{Cross Platform Filesystem Support}
To programmers that have used languages that do not require virtual machines,
concerns for cross platform availability of an application, more often arise.
This case study will use some simple filesystem operations to indicate what we
may and may not do with the language. We will investigate how:
\begin{itemize}
  \item Location to resources are handled
  \item Permissions for inodes are handled
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Protocol Implementation}
A topic that I have came accross in programming languages that is somewhat
interesting to see in implementation, are protocols. Notably \textbf{Erlang} 
makes this a breeze. Investigating this in Ada will be interesting. 

For this small project, we'll be implementing 5 parts of the Http protocol.
Namely the HEAD, GET, POST, PUT and DELETE methods. We refer to the RFC2616
manual \cite{RFC2616} for the definition of behaviours of these methods. Once
they are implemented in this case study using Ada, the project shall be tested
by using any mainstream browser such as \textit{Firefox} or \textit{Chromium}.

For the reader we extract the definitions and behaviour of these four methods.

\subsubsection{Overview of Http Protocol}
The Http protocol is a text, request-response protocol. The RFC2616
specification is quite detailed, but we will be implementing a very small
subset of the specification for this case study.

The Http version we are concerned with is \textbf{1.1}. There exists
indempodent and non indempodent methods in the Http specification. 

% TODO: Not sure if I want this paragraph (or possible rewriting required)
GET is described as an indempodent method. That is, if a request is being made
with the same specific set of parameters, then the response should be the same
each time that request is repeated. For example, if we had a function such as $
f(x) = x + 1 $, then each time we provided $ x = 1 $ we should always retrieve
`2'. We present the following table, which describes the methods we will be
implementing:
\\
\begin{table} 
\begin{center}
\begin{tabular}{| c | c |}
\hline
\textbf{Method} & \textbf{Type} \\ \hline \hline
HEAD   & Indempondent \\
GET    & Indempondent \\
POST   & Non-Indempondent \\
PUT    & Indempondent \\ 
DELETE & Indempondent \\
\hline
\end{tabular}
\end{center}
\caption{HTTP Method Indempodency}
\end{table}
\subsubsection{HEAD}
This Http method requests the header fields of an html document. The message
body is not to be retrieved. Here is an example of what http headers look like.
The definition is taken straight out of the manual:  
\lstinputlisting[caption=Header Definition,language=]{./src/misc/header-definition.txt}

Here is a more practical example. These headers are retrieved from \textit{www.google.ca}:
\lstinputlisting[caption=Html Header,language=]{./src/misc/html-header.txt}

And this is the expected html response definition from a successful request.
\lstinputlisting[caption=Http Response,language=]{./src/misc/http-response.txt}

\subsubsection{GET} 
A \textbf{GET} method is defined in the specification, to be used for
operations that require \textbf{reading} information. On the server side, this
should not tamper with the resources. 
A get request requires \textbf{Request-Line} field to be sent. It is up to the
server to look for the resource requested, and send the response afterwards.

Taken directly from the manual, here is a demonstration of what the GET request
looks like, when ``accessing www.w3.org'':
\lstinputlisting[caption=Http Get Request,language=]{./src/misc/get-request.txt}

\subsubsection{POST} \label{http:axios-post}
POST is the non-indempodent method we mentioned before. This means each time a
post request is sent, a resource must be created, always guaranteeing different
response, for a same request. An example for this would be creating a book with
common data fields such as \textit{author, year, title, etc...}

This is what a typical POST request looks like:
%TODO post request is required here % 

%TODO not sure if I'll have the time for this sort of thing
In this case study, we will be using this to write a text file on the server,
with the request body as file contents. It would be possible to retrieve these
contents later on. 

\subsubsection{PUT}
PUT is a indempodent method. It is typically used in order to update resources
on the sever side. For example, if we wish to update the book re
%TODO put request is required here % 

In this case study we will be using this to change a variable on the server.
That way it will be possible to start the server, change this value, and get a
response showing that the update was a success. It is quite possible to use
this along with AUnit in order unit test these features automatically. 

\subsubsection{DELETE} 
DELETE is an indempodent method. It is typically used in order to delete a
resource on a website.
We will be using this to delete resources that are created by the POST
definition of Axios (refer to \ref{http:axios-post}).

\subsection{First Steps}
The first steps in an Ada application is to define the \textit{project manager
file} for the given project as outlined on the manual \cite{GNATintro}.

%% TODO: Need to check if this is indeed the case. 
The GNAT project file abstracts a lot of the building details into this file.
It will take care even about other language builds, meaning that if you wish to
create, for example C extensions to the language, you could achieve this
easily, as opposed to tedious makefiles. 

Another added advantage is that GNAT Project Files also take into consideration
the file naming conventions. Another automated feature in this file is
automatic building of external libraries. There are various other ways to
achieve this, either on a makefile level, or alternatively using features in
certain SCM tools to clone and build the libraries automatically. 

A notable feature of the GPR files, is that hierarchical builds are allowed,
meaning that if different components require different builds, and different
dependencies, that build can be isolated to that specific build alone
\cite{GNATintro}. The hierarchical layering of the building process, also
exploits a similar aspect to that of a layered software architecture: different
layers can be developed at parallel, as could subsystems. 

\subsubsection{Deployment View}
The overall view of the system components can be seen in Figure \ref{fig:deployment}.
