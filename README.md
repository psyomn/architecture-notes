Architecture Notes
==================

A collection of notes formatted in latex. Some are ideas. Some are implemented.
They are all personal thoughts recorded over things I do, so certain things 
might be possible to be done better. If you want to contribute your thoughts
go right ahead and fork this repo, or send me a message even.

__NOTE__ You'll need plantuml in order to generate the pictures for the
documents. You can get plantuml [here](http://plantuml.sf.net).

#### Languages

Some minor case studies of some programming languages. They should provide a
nice reference point for anyone interrested in those programming languages.

#### Specifications

Some notes on things I like to analyse and maybe implement one day.
