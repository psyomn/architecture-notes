Architecture Notes
==================

A collection of notes formatted in latex. Some are ideas. Some are implemented.
They are all personal thoughts recorded over things I do, so certain things 
might be possible to be done better. If you want to contribute your thoughts
go right ahead and fork this repo, or send me a message even.

__NOTE__ You'll need plantuml in order to generate the pictures for the
documents. You can get plantuml [here](http://plantuml.sf.net).

#### Turtables

This explains the rationale behind the Ruby Gem `turntables`. Turntables is 
supposed to ease the development of applications that require their databases
to be updated and maintained from one release to another. This is inspired from
projects such as `rails`, and some `bukkit` plugins that I have observed.

#### Haze Game Editor

This is just some architecture notes and ideas, thoughts, etc I have when 
thinking about how to tackle a game editor. The game editor in question (and 
hypothetical in nature) is very inspired by RPG Toolkit, and RPG Maker. Maybe
one day when I actually have time, I would be able to develop something on that
respect.

#### Languages

Some minor case studies of some programming languages. They should provide a
nice reference point for anyone interrested in those programming languages.
