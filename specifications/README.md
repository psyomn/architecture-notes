# Specifications 

Minor writeups that deal more with analysis than actual implementation. More
like 'what if we built this that way'.

#### Turtables

This explains the rationale behind the Ruby Gem `turntables`. Turntables is 
supposed to ease the development of applications that require their databases
to be updated and maintained from one release to another. This is inspired from
projects such as `rails`, and some `bukkit` plugins that I have observed.

#### Haze Game Editor

This is just some architecture notes and ideas, thoughts, etc I have when 
thinking about how to tackle a game editor. The game editor in question (and 
hypothetical in nature) is very inspired by RPG Toolkit, and RPG Maker. Maybe
one day when I actually have time, I would be able to develop something on that
respect.
