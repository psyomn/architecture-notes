\section{A Case Study}

We have the basic idea to lay down the blueprints for a case study. The case
study shall provide us with an insight on difficulties that will arise in
design and implementation, but supply us with the benefits when everything is
done. For this case study we will be using Ruby, and writing a library (gem)
that will be able to be readily reused. We name this library `Turntables'.

We will include the best possible documentation in the respect of Software
Engineering. We will document aspects of analysis, and design, and present them
where appropriate. We will also note some functional requirements, and non
functional requirements where applicable. In the respect of design we will
present class diagrams and sequence diagrams as they will be the best form of
communication for this rather small software artifact.
