\subsection{Motivation (Userbase)} 

A primary motivation for making this engine and game editor on the user side,
would be that many have the desire to work on a videogame but do not have the
resources. Another fact that would make this software package desirable is that
if there are requests for feature implementation in the engine, then since the 
software is open source, they would be easilly implemented. 

\subsection{Motivation (Developer)}

A lot of technical implications exist in game development, and in our case we
wish to provide the tool on many different platforms. These aspects are all
something that can contribute to the technical growth of any contributing
developer.
