\section{Abstract}

Game editors are pretty poppular among amateur and professional gamers. You can
see such tools exist from the late 90s and 00s where projects like
\texttt{GameMaker}, and \texttt{RPGMaker2000} surfaced, and up to today, in
2015, where \texttt{Unity} is ever emerging in popularity.

This is a relatively small and loose specification, where we elaborate on what
we want for the tool to do, and define a modular core we can build on, and let
users extend, via the finished product.

\subsection{Motivation (Userbase)}

A primary motivation for making this engine and game editor on the user side,
would be that many have the desire to work on a videogame but do not have the
resources. Another fact that would make this software package desirable is that
if there are requests for feature implementation in the engine, then since the
software is open source, they would be easilly implemented.

\subsection{Motivation (Developer)}

A lot of technical implications exist in game development, and in our case we
wish to provide the tool on many different platforms. These aspects are all
something that can contribute to the technical growth of any contributing
developer.
