\section{Glossary} 

We explain the meaning of some of the jargon that may be found in this
document.

\subsubsection{World Specific}

\paragraph{Map}: A part of the world the game takes place in. 

\paragraph{Portal}: A connecting unit between map `A' and map `B'. 

\paragraph{Tile}: a (usually) square graphic that can be used as a pattern to 
fill in the space of the map. For example a ``grass pattern'' can be expressed
in one square graphic, and reused in order to build the map. 

\paragraph{Tileset}: A collection of tiles (as described above). Tilesets
usually have a particular style, or respect a scene (castle tilesets, should 
have things that are found in castles, overworld should have grass and trees,
etc).

\subsection{Entity / Character Specific} 

\paragraph{Entity}: A character in the game. Describes mainly NPCs such as 
characters that give hints on your quest, to treasure chests, etc. 

\paragraph{NPC}: Stands for `non-playable-character', and they are the people
the main character finds in villages, or eslewhere, that usually offer helpful
hints and tips.
