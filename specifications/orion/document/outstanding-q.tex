\section{Outstanding Questions}

Here is a list of questions that are not yet answered. Leaving them here to
check out in the future.

\subsection{General Questions}

\begin{itemize}
  \item Our tool should target what platforms? In other words, we have the tool
    that may be compiled to a few binaries, and the engine. The engine should
    run on Windows, and Linux (and maybe, eventually Mac). If the engine is
    cross platform, then there will be no problems, since the assets should not
    care of what the OS is currently.

  \item How do we deal with map transitions? Would this be a concern to be
    directly associated to the map object, or should connections be delegated to
    other objects? (For example, if we need to link map A and map B together, we
      could have an auxiliary object that knows about this connection betwen two
    maps).

  \item How do we deal with \textit{changing} maps? For example in a storyline
    where the earth can be split in two, separating characters from one side of
    the screen to the other, to obstructing passages.

\end{itemize}

\subsection{Language Specific Questions}

\begin{itemize}

\item Would interpreted and scripted languages like python or ruby serve as
better tools in contrast to compiled languages such as C++ / C, due to the
nature of said data driven system?

\item If we choose to use C++, can we use Lua for scripting specific things on
the game?

\end{itemize}
