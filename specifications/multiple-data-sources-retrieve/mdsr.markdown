# Multiple Data Source Retrieve

This is just a few notes that I wanted to put down and improve along the way. My
main question is what do you do when you have multiple sources, sharing similar
data, but in conflicting formats, or have different steps in order to retrieve
the data with.

How should these concerns be separated in such a fashion that we get a coherent
architecture, which can be extended without aging poses a somewhat interesting
challenge.
